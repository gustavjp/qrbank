# QRBank

QRBank is a teacher-focused classroom banking, behavior, jobs, rewards, and QR scanning web application.

The repository is being built incrementally from the approved product specification, architecture, database design, and migration plan.

## Current milestone

The current application foundation includes:

- FastAPI application entry point
- PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy 2.x database connectivity
- Alembic migrations
- User and classroom ORM mappings
- Argon2 password hashing
- opaque server-side session-token foundation
- classroom owner/membership creation
- health and readiness endpoints
- PostgreSQL-backed automated tests

Student banking, QR scanning, financial service code, rewards UI, and teacher-facing authentication pages are intentionally not implemented in this milestone.

## Local setup

Python 3.12+ and PostgreSQL are required.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Set the database connection:

```bash
export QRBANK_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://qrbank:qrbank@localhost:5432/qrbank"
```

Apply the schema:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Run the application:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

System checks:

- `GET /health` confirms the web process is running.
- `GET /ready` confirms PostgreSQL is reachable.

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

The integration test suite requires a disposable PostgreSQL database. GitHub Actions runs the suite against PostgreSQL 16.
